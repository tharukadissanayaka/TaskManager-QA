# 10-Minute Presentation Outline

**Objective:** Demonstrate a comprehensive approach to software testing and quality assurance.

### Slide 1: Title Slide

*   **Title:** Full-Stack Testing & Quality Assurance for a MERN Application
*   **Your Name/ID**
*   **Course/Assignment Name**

### Slide 2: TDD Approach & Demonstration

*   **Explain TDD:** Briefly describe the Red-Green-Refactor cycle.
    *   **Red:** Write a test that fails because the feature doesn't exist.
    *   **Green:** Write the simplest code to make the test pass.
    *   **Refactor:** Clean up the code while keeping the test green.
*   **Demonstration:**
    *   Show the `backend/tests/tasks.test.js` file.
    *   Point to the test `it('should create a new task')` (this was our "Red" step).
    *   Show the corresponding implementation in `backend/routes/tasks.js` (this was our "Green" step).
    *   Explain that the code is simple, so no major refactoring was needed, but mention the principle.

### Slide 3: BDD Approach & Demonstration

*   **Explain BDD:** Describe it as a way to test application behavior from the user's perspective.
*   **Demonstration:**
    *   Show the Gherkin feature file: `backend/features/add_task.feature`.
    *   Explain the `Given-When-Then` structure.
    *   Show the corresponding step definition in `backend/features/step_definitions/task_steps.js`.
    *   Run the test: `cd backend && npm run test:bdd` and show the passing result.

### Slide 4: Test Automation: UI & API

*   **API Tests:**
    *   Show the `backend/tests/tasks.test.js` file again.
    *   Explain that these Supertest scripts act as our automated API tests, checking for success (`201`) and error (`400`) status codes.
*   **Selenium UI Tests:**
    *   Show the `selenium-tests/ui.test.js` file.
    *   Explain the two scenarios: adding a task successfully and handling an error.
    *   Briefly run one of the tests (if time permits) or show a screenshot of a successful run.

### Slide 5: Continuous Integration (CI/CD)

*   **Explain CI:** The practice of automatically building and testing code every time a change is pushed.
*   **Demonstration:**
    *   Show the `.github/workflows/ci.yml` file.
    *   Explain the key steps: `checkout`, `install dependencies`, `run tests`.
    *   Show a screenshot of a successful pipeline run from your GitHub repository's "Actions" tab.

### Slide 6: Performance & Security Testing

*   **Load Testing (JMeter):**
    *   Show the `load-testing/TasksApiTestPlan.jmx` file in JMeter.
    *   Show a screenshot of the "Summary Report" after a test run.
    *   Briefly explain the key metrics (Average, Throughput, Error %).
*   **Security (OWASP):**
    *   Show the `SECURITY.md` file.
    *   Briefly explain one vulnerability (e.g., Broken Access Control) and show the "before" and "after" code snippets.

### Slide 7: Defect Management & Quality Metrics

*   **Defect Tracking:**
    *   Show a screenshot of a bug you logged in Jira or Bugzilla (using the content from `BUG_REPORTS.md`).
    *   Briefly explain the Root Cause Analysis for one bug.
*   **Quality Metrics:**
    *   Show the `QUALITY_METRICS.md` file.
    *   Explain the Defect Density calculation for the `tasks.js` module.
    *   Briefly explain the concept of MTTF.

### Slide 8: Code Quality (SonarQube)

*   **Explain Static Analysis:** How tools like SonarQube find issues without running the code.
*   **Demonstration:**
    *   Show the "Code with Smells" example from `QUALITY_METRICS.md`.
    *   Explain the duplication issue.
    *   Show the refactored code as the solution.
    *   (Optional) Show a screenshot of a SonarQube dashboard if you run the analysis.

### Slide 9: Conclusion

*   Summarize the testing activities performed.
*   Reiterate the importance of a multi-layered testing strategy for building high-quality software.

### Slide 10: Q&A

*   "Thank you. Any questions?"
